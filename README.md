# Netflix clone

I build this page to train myself in using some stuff around **React**, like functional components and React Hooks. As the title says, this is a (partial) clone of the Netflix web application. Browse the Neflix catalog, click on the movie or TV series that intrigues you and watch the trailer. All data related to the movies are real and have been fetched from the TMDB Api (https://www.themoviedb.org/).

If you are at least a little bit curious and want to see the app you can click on the link below:

**Little disclaimer**: I used a library to fetch trailers but apparently sometimes it finds trailers for different movies (similar title) or it doesn't find anything. Showing ALL movies trailer was not the aim of this work: I hope you'll forgive me ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Have fun ‚úåüèª
